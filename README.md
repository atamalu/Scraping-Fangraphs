# Web Scraping FanGraphs
Here is my tutorial on web scraping data from FanGraphs.com. This is meant for experienced beginners and above. If you'd prefer, you can also just use the [finished functions](Finished_Functions.R).

* Part 1: [Url Construction](Pt_1_Url_Construction.md)

  - covers how to write a simple function that essentially "copies and pastes" the parameters you want (i.e. types of splits) to create a custom query url in R.
  
* Part 2: [Data Acquisition and Cleaning](Pt_2_Data_Acquisition_and_Cleaning.md)

  - covers using the function from part 1 to retrieve that data and make it usable
  
* Part 3: [Data Exploration](Pt_3_Data_Exploration.md)

  - various visualizations leading up to hypotheses
  
* Part 4: [Data Analysis]

  - multilevel modeling
  - coming soon

Out of respect for the site, please utilize `write.csv` and `read.csv` as much as possible!
