# Scraping-Fangraphs
Here is my tutorial on web scraping data from FanGraphs.com. This is meant for experienced beginners and above. Part 1 covers how to write a simple function that essentially "copies and pastes" the parameters you want (i.e. types of splits) to create a custom query url in R. Part 2 is more in-depth and covers using the function from part 1 to retrieve that data and make it usable. If you'd rather, you can just use the [finished functions](Finished_Functions.R).

Out of respect for the site, please utilize `write.csv` and `read.csv` as much as possible!
